undoEmail/undoEmail.php

- classes that provide a link to a database to delete or insert content.


If the user sends an e-mail, he has a few seconds to cancel the message. This can be set in config.ini.

We can use hooks to attach other source code or provide plugin functions.

In the meantime, the message is temporarily stored in a database with the unsent emails table, which is linked to

the email ID, recipient and sender, where the message header is also assigned, and body. Preset expressions can be stored in $smtp.

When sending an email to a recipient, a connection to the database takes place based on the host name, login name,

password and database name. An associative field is then created from the information already inserted in the pre-prepared table.

If an email is sent to a recipient, the information about that email is deleted from this table that serves
Â¨
to keep the information before the actual sending due to the possible cancellation of the sending by the sender

to discard all information associated with a given ID and discard the email from the queue. After this step, the connection is closed

with database.

undoEmail/buttons.js

- creates buttons that appear when you send an email

The sending can then be confirmed or the email returned with the Undo button.
